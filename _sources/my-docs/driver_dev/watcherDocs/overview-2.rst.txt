Plan-overview 2
=================

Plan to maintain functionality in separate Python modules and build a script that processes hexadecimal values into human-readable text using the ``pci_ids.h`` header is a solid approach. Here's how you can think about the next steps:

1. **Modular Design**

   - Keep the functionality of each script focused and independent. For example, the script you shared is responsible for reading device information from sysfs. Another script can be dedicated to parsing and converting hexadecimal values using ``pci_ids.h``.

2. **Data Exchange Between Scripts**

   - Use a structured format (e.g., dictionaries, JSON, or custom objects) to pass data between scripts. For instance, the script that reads device information can output a dictionary like:

     .. code-block:: python

         {
             "vendor": "0x8086",
             "device": "0x1234",
             "class": "0x0c03"
         }

   - This output can then be passed to the next script for processing.

3. **Hexadecimal to Human-Readable Conversion**

   - Write a script that takes the hexadecimal values (e.g., ``0x8086``) and looks them up in the ``pci_ids.h`` file to find the corresponding human-readable names (e.g., ``Intel Corporation``).
   - This script should:
   
     - Parse the ``pci_ids.h`` file to build a lookup table (e.g., a dictionary mapping hex values to names).
     - Accept input from the previous script (e.g., the dictionary of hex values).
     - Replace the hex values with their human-readable equivalents.

4. **Reusable Lookup Logic**

   - The logic for parsing ``pci_ids.h`` and performing the lookup can be encapsulated in a function or class. This makes it reusable across multiple scripts or modules.

5. **Output Formatting**

   - Once the conversion is done, format the output in a user-friendly way. For example:

     .. code-block:: text

         Vendor: Intel Corporation
         Device: Xeon E3-1200 v5/E3-1500 v5/6th Gen Core Processor Host Bridge/DRAM Registers
         Class: USB Controller

6. **Error Handling**

   - Handle cases where a hexadecimal value is not found in ``pci_ids.h``. You can either skip it, log a warning, or provide a default value (e.g., "Unknown").

7. **Integration**

   - Combine the scripts into a pipeline. For example:
   
     - Script 1 reads device information from sysfs.
     - Script 2 converts hex values to human-readable text using ``pci_ids.h``.
     - Script 3 formats and displays the final output.

8. **Future Extensibility**

   - Design the scripts so they can be easily extended. For example, if you later want to support additional fields or different lookup tables, the changes should be minimal.

By separating concerns and building a pipeline of scripts, you create a flexible and maintainable system. Each script does one thing well, and they work together to achieve the desired functionality. This approach also aligns with the Unix philosophy of small, composable tools.
